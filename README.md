# 🎟️ **Ticket Booking System (CLI-Based)**  

This project is my first **Java-based Ticket Booking System**, designed to strengthen my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** skills while implementing practical functionalities like **user authentication, train search, ticket booking, and cancellation**. *Special thanks to [Lovepreet Singh](https://github.com/AlphaDecodeX) for his amazing tutorials and projects.
